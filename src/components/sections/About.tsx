                At Fine Tuned Pilates, LLC, we believe that your studio's success begins with dependable, expert support. Our journey started when we recognized a major gap in the Pilates industry: there was simply no reliable maintenance and support system available for studios. Without proper care, even the best equipment could fall short—impacting safety, performance, and ultimately, your business's success.

                      Drawing from our personal experiences, we witnessed firsthand how challenging it was for studios to secure the reliable maintenance and support they needed. Without the dedicated expertise provided by myself and Dennis, even studios managed by industry veterans like Kathy would have faced significant challenges in keeping their equipment in optimal condition.

                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">

With Garrett's technical expertise as a Mechanical Engineer, Dennis's 17 years of hands-on experience in assembly, maintenance, and relocation, and Kathy's deep industry insight from years of successful studio ownership, our team combines a wealth of knowledge and passion to give you peace of mind.
